## Task 3: Lab Questions (11 marks)

### Q1
Git is a distributed version control system used to track changes in code, collaborate with others, and manage project history. GitHubis a website that provides hosting for Git repositories, along with additional features such as issue tracking, pull requests, and collaboration tools.

Sources:
https://git-scm.com/doc
https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/hello-world

### Q2
A distributed version control system  allows every developer to have a complete copy of the repository (including its history) on their local machine. This design enables developers to work offline, perform commits locally, and synchronize changes with others when needed.

## Task 4: Video Questions (4 marks)

Include answers as described in the [Lab 1](L1.md) file.

### Q1
The video explains the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), which is basically the step-by-step process of building, testing, and maintaining software. There are seven main phases: planning, requirement analysis, design, implementation and coding, testing, deployment, and maintenance. It starts with the customer sharing their idea, and the team turns it into a detailed plan. Then, developers build the app, testers make sure everything works, and finally, it gets released to users. Even after the app goes live, the maintenance phase kicks in to fix issues and add new features, repeating the cycle.


### Q2
SDLC is important because it keeps everything organized and helps teams work together. By following these phases, major problems can be avoided. Like bugs that might let someone access another userâ€™s account. Testing make sure that software works as expected before it reaches users, and the maintenance phase helps keep things running. Overall, SDLC makes sure the project stays on track, delivers high quality results, and can handle future changes or challenges without falling the system.
